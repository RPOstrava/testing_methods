# 4testing_methods


The site will be used for automated testing in several different programs/frameworks. the texts on the page will be in the Czech language.

The site is intentionally more error-prone so that it can be tested meaningfully

Different methods will be tested (e2e, unit etc)

27.2.2024 css changes updated.

4.3.2024 starting with cypress testing (after fixing conflicts with github).

6.3.2024 E2E and Unit test uploaded.

7.3.2024 smoke and integration test added.

11.3.2024 Pytest is next, but I still have to learn it, at least the basics.
12.3.2024 Pytest cancelled. project is ended.
